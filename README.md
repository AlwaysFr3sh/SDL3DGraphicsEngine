# SDL3DGraphicsEngine
3D Graphics engine from scratch using SDL for window and dots :)

I will write a proper README when I have something that works, for now just know that I am writing this by following along with this: https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/

For now also this is just rasterization. I don't think my mac can handle the Raytracing stuff

# TODO
- Rasterization (with shading)
- Matrix multiplication
- Projection & rotations etc.
- Port to C (instead of weird c++ c hybrid)
- Single file or split?
- Struct or class to abstract SDL so we can swap it out for any drawing library
- Clipping
- Draw only visible triangles
- load Blender files
- Camera movement?
- Teapot :)
