# SDL3DGraphicsEngine
3D Graphics engine from scratch using SDL for window and dots :)

I will write a proper README when I have something that works, for now just know that I am writing this by following along with this: https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/

For now also this is just rasterization. I don't think my mac can handle the Raytracing stuff
